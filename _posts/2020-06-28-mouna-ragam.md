##### Really?
Mouna Ragam is not devoid of scenes which make the viewer think "Really?". Manohar 
keeps his bike to block a bus in which Divya is travelling, to make her confess her
love - A traffic jam ensues, but no one except Divya seems to be pissed off. Manohar 
goes one step ahead to proclaim his love for Divya using her college principal's 
intercom - And it seems it is okay for any stranger to do it.
Also, the way in which Manohar dies is kinda irrational. A bike accident, may be, could 
have been more sensible.

##### Divya v/s Divya
There are quite some similarities in the lives of Divya from Mouna Ragam (MN) and Divya from 
Bangalore Days (BD):
- Both the Divyas realise that they don't want this alliance in some point around their marriage: Divya (BD)
tells her cousins just before her marriage, and Divya (MN) confesses the same to her mother after her 
marriage.
- If it was Divya herself who spoiled their first night (pretending to be sleepy) in MN, it was Divya's
husband Das (who had a business call) who spolied it in BD.
- Later, the viewers come to know the real reason for the above behaviour - both Divya (MN) and Das were
haunted by the demise of their ex-lovers.
