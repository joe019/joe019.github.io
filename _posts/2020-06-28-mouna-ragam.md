### Ragam aka Love
"Ragam" is an important element of Indian music, just as important as love in married life. And there 
couldn't have been a better name for Divya and CK's story - they love each other, but both fails to 
profess their love, making it "silent".

### Mani Ratnam delivers 
The best part of the movie is probably Mani Ratnam's one liners. Both Divya and CK deliver quite a few 
harsh dialogues, tit for tat, and Mani Ratnam succeeds in inflicting the pain of characters in the mind 
of viewers. One thing that could have been better is the transition of Divya from hating CK to start 
falling for him, which seemed a little abrupt.

### Divya and CK
Divya is a carefree and bold woman, pampered a lot by her parents. She is adamant of not marrying a 
stranger and is against the conventional Indian process of match making. But she is defeated in standing
by her resolve by her parents - a middle class father who yearns to place his daughters in safe hands,
and a mother who had burried all her desires since her marriage. And the image of an Indian middle class
mother hasn't changed quite a lot - the same kind of sacrifices are made by Amrita's mother in Thappad, 
a movie released more than three decades after Mouna Ragam. <br>
CK is a mature, kind character, showing traits of patience unmatched among average human beings. The 
character sketch of CK makes the viewers sympathise with him more than Divya. And it is some kind of 
poetic justice or a balancing act that, in the end, it is indeed Divya who breaks the "silence" and 
reveals her love to CK.

### Really?
Mouna Ragam is not devoid of scenes which make the viewer think "Really?". Manohar 
keeps his bike to block a bus in which Divya is travelling, to make her confess her
love - A traffic jam ensues, but no one except Divya seems to be pissed off. Manohar 
goes one step ahead to proclaim his love for Divya using her college principal's 
intercom - And it seems it is okay for any stranger to do it. Also, the way in which Manohar dies is 
kinda irrational. A bike accident, may be, could have been more sensible. 

### Divya v/s Divya
There are quite some similarities in the lives of Divya from Mouna Ragam (MN) and Divya from 
Bangalore Days (BD): Both the Divyas realise that they don't want their alliance in some point around their marriage - Divya (BD)
tells her cousins just before her marriage, and Divya (MN) confesses the same to her mother after her 
marriage. If it was Divya herself who spoiled their first night (pretending to be sleepy) in MN, it was Divya's
husband Das (who had a business call) who spolied it in BD. Later, the viewers come to know the real reason for the above behaviour - both Divya (MN) and Das were
haunted by the demise of their ex-lovers.
