### Ragam aka Love
"Ragam" is an important element of Indian music, just as important as love in married life. And there couldn't have 
been a better name for Divya and CK's story - they love each other, but both fails to profess their love, making it 
silent or "Mouna".

### Mani Ratnam strikes 
The best part of the movie is probably Mani Ratnam's one liners. Both Divya and CK deliver quite a few harsh dialogues, 
tit for tat, and Mani Ratnam succeeds in inflicting the pain of characters in the mind of viewers. One thing that could 
have been better, though, is the transition of Divya from hating CK to start falling for him, which seemed a little 
abrupt.

### Divya and CK
Divya is a carefree and bold woman, pampered a lot by her parents. She is adamant of not marrying a stranger and is 
against the conventional Indian process of match making. But she is defeated in standing by her resolve by her parents -
a middle class father who yearns to place his daughters in safe hands, and a mother who had buried all her desires 
since her marriage. And the image of an Indian middle class mother hasn't changed quite a lot - the same kind of 
sacrifices are made by Amrita's mother in Thappad, a movie released more than three decades after Mouna Ragam. 
CK is a mature, kind character, showing traits of patience unmatched among average human beings. The characterisation 
of CK makes the viewers sympathise with him more than Divya. And it is some kind of poetic justice or a balancing act 
that, in the end, it is indeed Divya who breaks the "silence" and reveals her love to CK.

### Really?
Mouna Ragam is not devoid of scenes which make the viewer think "Really?". Manohar keeps his bike to block a bus in 
which Divya is travelling, to make her confess her love - a traffic jam ensues, but no one except Divya seems to be 
pissed off. Manohar goes one step ahead to proclaim his love for Divya using her college principal's intercom - and it 
seems it is okay for any stranger to do it. Also, the way in which Manohar dies is kinda irrational. A bike accident, 
may be, could have been more sensible. 

### Divya v/s Divya
There are quite some similarities in the lives of Divya from Mouna Ragam and Divya (aka "Kunju") from Bangalore Days: 
Both the Divyas realise that they don't want their alliance in some point around their marriage - Kunju tells her 
cousins just before her marriage, and Divya confesses the same to her mother after her marriage. If it was Divya herself
who spoiled their first night (pretending to be sleepy) in Mouna Ragam, it was Kunju's husband Das (business call first,
first night second) who spoiled it in Bangalore Days. Later, the viewers come to know the real reason for their 
behaviour - both Divya and Das were haunted by the demise of their ex-lovers.
